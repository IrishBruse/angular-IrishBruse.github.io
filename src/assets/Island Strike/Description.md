Island Strike is a game I made for the [Kenney Game Jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2021) I am very happy with how this game turned out.
It came 46th out of 366.
It was a big improvement over my previous game jam as I had way more experience making games and knew what to expect from a Game jam thanks to my previous Ludum dare.
This was a great challenge to see how well I work under pressure and under a time constraint.
