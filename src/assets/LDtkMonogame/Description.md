LDtkMonogame is a library for importing levels made in the [LDtk](https://ldtk.io/) Level Editor.
I have made a few packages for it to help with working with the files.
A contentpipeline extension and code generator that reads the entities in the files and converts them to statically typed C# classes.
I also have a wiki for people to use as documentation when using the library.
It can be accessed [here](https://www.ethanconneely.com/LDtkMonogame).
