Monoboy is a Gameboy emulator written in C#.
It was made to help me learn bitwise operations and the lower level parts of C#.
I learned a lot about project management as this was the biggest piece of software I had ever written at the time.
I also improved my ability to structure code in a way that was easier to come back to and maintain.
