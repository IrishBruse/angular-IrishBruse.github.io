The IrishBruse Launcher is a way to share all my projects and software along with all the versions, letting you see the progress in each project.
It uses the Dropbox Api to download the projects from their cloud service and then unzips the game ready to play.
It's all gotten live from the service, so I can add and remove games, software, and versions as I want.
It was the first Golang application I wrote too, as I wanted to give a try at a new language and Go had some handy features that made making this application a lot easier than in C#.
